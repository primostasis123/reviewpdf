1. Upload PDF: Start by uploading the PDF file of the research paper you want to read. This can typically be done through a user-friendly interface on the app.
2. Text Extraction: The app would then use optical character recognition (OCR) or other text extraction techniques to convert the content of the PDF into machine-readable text.
3. Ask Questions: Once the text is extracted, you can interact with the app by asking it questions about the content. For example, you might ask for a summary of the paper, clarification on specific concepts, or information about the methodology used in the research.
4 .Natural Language Processing (NLP): The app would use NLP algorithms to understand your questions and provide relevant answers based on the content of the research paper.
5. Summarization: You could also use the app to generate concise summaries of specific sections or the entire paper, making it easier to grasp the main points without reading the entire document.
